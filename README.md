# URLab -- MuJoCo Physics in Unreal Engine

![URLab](docs/images/hero.png)

URLab (Unreal Robotics Lab) is an Unreal Engine 5 plugin that embeds the [MuJoCo](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco) physics engine directly into the editor and runtime. Drag-and-drop MJCF XML import, a component-based architecture that maps 1:1 to MuJoCo elements, the full MuJoCo C API accessible from C++ and Blueprints, ZMQ networking for external control, Python policy integration, 40+ sensor types, 8 actuator types, debug visualization, and a record/replay system.

## When To Use URLab

- You need photorealistic rendering with accurate contact physics (sim-to-real transfer, synthetic data generation).
- You want to control MuJoCo robots from Python or ROS 2 while rendering in Unreal Engine.
- You want Unreal's ecosystem (Blueprints, Sequencer, Marketplace assets, Niagara) with physics-accurate robots.

## Quick Start

1. Clone into your project's `Plugins/` folder. Build third-party libraries once (`third_party/build_all.ps1`).
2. Drag an MJCF `.xml` file into the Content Browser. The importer creates a complete Articulation Blueprint.
3. Place an `AAMjManager` in your level. Place the generated Blueprint.
4. Hit Play. MuJoCo runs on an async physics thread; Unreal handles rendering.

See the [Getting Started](https://urlab-sim.github.io/UnrealRoboticsLab/getting_started/) guide for a full walkthrough.

## Key Features

- **MJCF Import** -- drag-and-drop `.xml`, builds full body/joint/actuator/sensor tree as an Articulation Blueprint.
- **Quick Convert** -- attach `UMjQuickConvertComponent` to any Static Mesh and it becomes a MuJoCo physics body. No XML needed.
- **40+ sensors, 8 actuator types, 4 joint types** -- position, velocity, motor, muscle, damper, adhesion, cylinder, general actuators; hinge, slide, ball, free joints; accelerometer, gyro, force/torque, touch, rangefinder, frame tracking, camera, and more.
- **ZMQ networking** -- stream sensor data out and receive actuator commands in via PUB/SUB sockets. Connect Python, ROS 2, or any ZMQ-speaking process.
- **Debug visualization** -- toggle contact forces, joint axes, collision geometry (articulations and Quick Convert separately), all via hotkeys.
- **Record and replay** -- capture trajectories, play back frame-by-frame, CSV import, snapshot/restore full simulation state.
- **Blueprint API** -- compile, reset, step, read sensors, set controls, capture snapshots, toggle debug drawing, all from Blueprint.
- **MjSimulate dashboard** -- in-editor widget with physics parameter tuning, actuator sliders, sensor readouts, live camera feeds.
- **Keyframe system** -- reset to named keyframes, hold keyframe poses (via ctrl or direct qpos injection), per-articulation dropdown in the dashboard.
- **Possess and walk** -- possess any articulation as a Pawn, WASD control with twist velocity commands over ZMQ.
- **Cinematic tools** -- orbit camera, keyframe camera with waypoint paths, impulse launchers for perturbation testing.
- **CoACD decomposition** -- one-click convex decomposition for non-convex meshes, cached by content hash.
- **Heightfield terrain** -- convert Unreal Landscape actors into MuJoCo heightfields.

See the [full documentation](https://urlab-sim.github.io/UnrealRoboticsLab/) for details.

## Python Integration

URLab communicates with external systems over ZMQ. The companion package [**urlab_bridge**](https://urlab-sim.github.io/UnrealRoboticsLab/guides/policy_bridge/) (separate repository, same organization) provides Python middleware for remote control, RL policy deployment, sensor monitoring, and ROS 2 bridging.

## Requirements

- **Unreal Engine 5.7+**
- **Windows** (Win64). Linux is experimental.
- **MuJoCo 3.7+** -- bundled in `third_party/`, built from source.
- **Visual Studio 2022** or compatible C++ toolchain.
- **CMake 3.24+** -- for building third-party libraries.
- **Python 3.11+** -- optional, for `urlab_bridge` policies.
- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** -- optional, for Python dependency management.

## Installation

> **⚠️ Critical:** This is a C++ plugin. You **must** be using a C++ project. If your project is Blueprints-only, add a dummy C++ class via *Tools > New C++ Class* before starting.

### 1. Clone the Plugin
Clone this repo into your project's `Plugins` folder:
```bash
cd "YourProject/Plugins"
git clone https://github.com/URLab-Sim/UnrealRoboticsLab.git
```

### 2. Build Dependencies
Navigate to the plugin's `third_party` folder and run the build script to fetch and compile MuJoCo, CoACD, and ZMQ:
```powershell
cd UnrealRoboticsLab/third_party
.\build_all.ps1
```
*(If this script fails with a **Stack Overflow** error, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below).*

### 3. Compile & Launch
1. Right-click your `.uproject` and select **Generate Visual Studio project files**.
2. Build the solution in VS2022/Rider and launch the Editor.
3. **Important:** In the Content Browser, go to **Settings (Gear Icon)** and check **"Show Plugin Content"** to see the UI and assets.

## Troubleshooting

### "CL.exe" Stack Overflow (Error 0xC00000FD)
If `build_all.ps1` fails during the MuJoCo sensor build, your compiler has run out of internal memory. This is an upstream issue with older MSVC toolsets.
* **Fix:** Update Visual Studio 2022 to the latest (17.10+) or use **VS 2025**.
* **Workaround:** Run the build with an increased stack flag:
    `cmake -B build ... -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="/F10000000"`

### "Simulate" Dashboard is Missing
* Ensure an `MjManager` actor is placed in your level.
* Check that "Show Plugin Content" is enabled in your Content Browser settings.

  |-- AMjArticulation (robot / mechanism, possessable Pawn)
  |     |-- UMjBody -> UMjHingeJoint, UMjGeom, UMjSensor, ...
  |     |-- UMjActuator (position, velocity, motor, muscle, ...)
  |     '-- UMjKeyframe, UMjDefault, UMjEquality, UMjTendon
  |
  |-- UMjQuickConvertComponent (on any Static Mesh actor)
  |-- AMjHeightfieldActor (Landscape -> MuJoCo heightfield)
